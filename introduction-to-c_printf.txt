/*
	c_printf is an umbrella name used to encapsulate a group of C++(11/0x) 
	language functions for extended formatted-printing. 
	The project aims to provide a thin auxiallary layer atop that of fprintf.
	Most functionality works, in much a similar manner to that of its patternal
	counter-part(s)	i.e printf, fprintf etc. 

	Aside from guarranteed type-safety (unlike that of it predecesors) 
	c_printf also introduces the feature of colour token specification. 
	With this, users are able to specify, as part of the format string, the 
	colour of all or some of the format-string-text within console output. 
	Alongside this is also the addition of map tokens which enable users the 
	ability to map specific strings with certain token value(s).

	Extending on the use of variadic arguments, c_printf also permits users
	the ability to opt for the use of a Tuple object which then acts as a 
	container for the to-be-printed arguments ordered in correspondence with 
	the argument layout as specified within the format string. 

	If colour configuration is enabled, the function will throw a _cpf_err 
	exception on condition that an invalid token is encountered on parsing. In 
	the case that a user opts to use features which are not available for a 
	platform (or terminal), the function produce one or more of the following:

	-	the format string may remain unchanged. 
	-	cause an an exception to be thrown.
	-	produce undefined output to specifed stream
