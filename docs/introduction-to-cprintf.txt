	Well, as you may have already seen, cprintf is an umbrella name (library) used to encapsulate a 
	group of C++(11/0x) language functions for extended formatted-printing. 
	The project aims to provide a thin auxiallary layer atop that of fprintf with most functionality 
	working in much a similar manner to that of its patternal standard counter-part(s) i.e printf, 
	fprintf etc. 

	...
	
	How to set-up cprintf
	
	This project uses CMake as a build configuration tool. Those who do not have a copy of CMake can obtain a copy 
	from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
	
	This basic set-up helper doc assumes the use of CMake from the command-line, those that wish to use the Graphical
	User Interface can use various on-line tutorials on how to do it.
	
	Make sure it (CMake executable) is in your <PATH> upon installation. This is typically done automatically by 
	the installer. You can confirm this by calling Cmake from you console/terminal after installation has completed.
	This can be done by simply typing "cmake" in you console. If its not recognised as a valid command, either verify 
	that its location is contained in your system environment variable <PATH> and restart the console/ terminal
	application OR you may need to simply restart your console/ terminal.
	
	Steps:
	
	* change directory to the root directory of cprintf "cd c:/path/to/cprintf"
	* create a build directry and cd into it i.e "mkdir build -> cd build"
	* call CMake (this is still from within your build directory)
		- cmake -DCPF_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON ..
	
	The above steps should configure the project and create a Visual Studio solution file for you if on 
	Microsoft Windows.
	If on Windows, you need only open the solution file to build and run the samples. Linux users can
	(as one of the many methods) simply call cmake again from within the build directory as defined below:
	"cmake --build ./"
	
	From here on you can begin to inspect the code samples and get familiar with on how to use the library's 
	interface.
	
	The samples are organised by category aimed at highlighting the keys feature and aspects of the library
	and how to use them.

	As this project is still a work-in-progress, feedback is always welcome. I also ask that: be there a
	need to improve a particular feature, it may not always be feesable for me to attend to the issue immidiately
	as I have other commitments.
	Other than that, I hope you enjoy using cprintf and that [it will] be helpful in the development as-well-as 
	enhancement of your work irrespective of your endeavours.
