Wellcome to the "c_printf" Project!!

This is a small open source project which to implement an extended version of
the standard printf (fprintf) function. 

Aside from guarranteed type-safety (unlike that of the original printf) c_printf also aims to provide extended functionality that permit developers the ability specify colour format and much more. 

For numerous reasons the functionailty available on the Windows operating system is limited in comparison to that of the *nix family of operating systems. This includes specifying text attributes with the following traits:
-	boldness, 
-	blinking,
-	clearing screen
-	extended dim colour specification
-	256 colour support
	and more ...   


Thank you and I hope you enjoy using it in your projects.
